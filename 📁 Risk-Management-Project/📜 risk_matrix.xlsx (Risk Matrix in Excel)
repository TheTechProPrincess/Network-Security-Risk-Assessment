The project includes a Risk Matrix that visualizes risks in a structured format.

ðŸ“Š Risk Matrix Example:

Impact â†“ / Likelihood â†’	Low (1)	Medium (2)	High (3-5)
High (5)	Medium	High	Critical
Medium (3-4)	Low	Medium	High
Low (1-2)	Low	Low	Medium

ðŸŸ¢ Green = Low Risk, ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Medium Risk, ðŸ”´ Red = High/Critical Risk
